Description: Provides fast computation of path signatures for multivariate time series 
    and paths. Path signatures are iterated integrals that uniquely characterize paths 
    and are widely used in machine learning, quantitative finance, and time series 
    analysis. The implementation uses Chen's identity for efficient computation and 
    includes OpenMP parallelization for improved performance on multi-core systems.
